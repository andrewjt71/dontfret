        <h2>Free Guitar Learning Tool for Mastering Music Theory</h2>
        <p>Don't Fret It is a comprehensive guitar learning tool designed to help guitarists of all levels master essential music theory concepts. Whether you're a beginner learning your first chords or an advanced player perfecting your interval recognition, our interactive fretboard trainer provides the perfect practice environment.</p>

        <h3>Guitar Note Training</h3>
        <p>Master the guitar fretboard with our note training mode. Learn to identify every note on all six strings, from open strings to the 12th fret and beyond. This fundamental skill is essential for any guitarist who wants to understand music theory and improve their playing.</p>

        <h3>Guitar Interval Training</h3>
        <p>Understanding intervals is crucial for building chords, constructing scales, and developing your ear.</p>
        <p>
          Intervals are fundamental to understanding how chords are constructed. At their core, chords are built by stacking specific intervals on top of a root note. For example, a major chord consists of a root note, plus a major 3rd interval, plus a perfect 5th interval above the root. This understanding of intervals allows you to build, name, and modify chords - whether you're turning a major chord into a minor one or adding a seventh to create more complex harmonies.

          The relationship between intervals and scales is equally important. Scales are essentially sequences of notes arranged at specific interval distances from each other. Take the major scale as an example - it follows a pattern of whole steps and half steps (W-W-H-W-W-W-H) that creates its characteristic sound. Once you understand these interval relationships, you can construct any scale starting from any root note.

          Intervals are also crucial for navigating the fretboard effectively. The beauty of intervals is that they maintain consistent patterns across the guitar neck (with a slight adjustment needed between the G and B strings due to the guitar's standard tuning). By learning these interval patterns, you gain the ability to play arpeggios, scales, and chords fluently anywhere on the neck.

          Perhaps one of the most practical applications of interval knowledge is in transposition. When you understand a musical phrase or chord progression in terms of its intervals, you can easily move it to any key by shifting the entire pattern up or down the neck while maintaining the same interval relationships. This skill is invaluable for adapting songs to different vocal ranges or playing in different keys with other musicians.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our interval training mode helps you recognize the distance between notes, from minor 2nds to perfect octaves. This knowledge is fundamental for chord construction and scale building.
        </p>
        <h3>Guitar Chord Training</h3>
        <p>Learn chord construction from the ground up. Our chord training mode teaches you to identify the individual notes that make up major, minor, diminished, augmented, and seventh chords. Understanding chord theory will transform your playing and songwriting abilities.</p>

        <h3>Perfect for Guitar Teachers and Students</h3>
        <p>Whether you're a guitar teacher looking for effective practice tools or a student wanting to supplement your lessons, Don't Fret It provides the perfect platform for mastering guitar theory. Our interactive approach makes learning engaging and effective.</p>
